<b>Technologies</b> I used in this project were: Responsive layout, Media queries

<b>Challenges I faced:</b>
<br>
<br>
I think the only challange I faced were the hover states, they just dont come naturally to me yet.
-I looked at the design they made for 375px but I do not have a device like that so I went with 430px+ so I can actually see the mobile version of this on my phone;
- Any suggestions or advice would be much appreaciated.
