In this small project, you'll build out your social link-sharing profile. You can even personalize it and use it to share all your social profiles!
<br>
<br>
Your challenge is to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

<b>Challenges I faced:</b>

I think the only challange I faced were the hover states, they just dont come naturally to me yet.

I also looked at the design they made for 375px but I do not have a device like that so I went with 430px+ so I can actually see the mobile version of this on my phone;

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreaciated.
